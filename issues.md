## I generally resolve issues fairly quuickly, most within hours.  <br>If you open an issue, and ask me for help, I must have the following.


### I need the output. All of the output. <br>

If it's a  four page stack trace, give it to me.  I want it all. <br>
__Don't worry about looking stupid__,  We all do stupid stuff, <br>
and I am not going to be jackass about it.<br>
 _If I see the same stupid mistake several times,<br>
 it tells me that it's not you, it's me and <br>
I need to change something so people understand it better._ <br>
___
### If it is stream related,  I need the stream.  <br>

In most cases, all I need is a few seconds that contain the SCTE-35 in question. <br>
If you cannot show me the stream, I cannot help you. <br>
___
### If it's code related, I need to see your code.

I don't want a "snippet", <br> 
__I need working code.__ Don't be shy abiout it, show me the code. Again,   <br>
__I won't be a jackass about it,__ and if I know a better way to do it, I'll show you. <br> 
If you have a better way, show me. We both win. <br>
___
### I expect you to provide feedback, and let me know that your problem is resolved.

 Don't just disappear. __You opened the issue, when your problem is resolved, close it.__ <br>
 It's not about you, it's about the next person. __You have an obligation to make the information  <br>
usable to others, that's what makes open source software work.__ <br>
