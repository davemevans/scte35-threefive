# My thoughts on stackoverflow.com 

__My stackoverflow account was recently suspended__ .
About 34 stackoverflow people sent me a message claiming that I was "astro-turfing" and "overpromoting a product". 
They went on to question the validity of my answers
and included a link to their advertising sales department. 

### I checked my stackoverflow history. In five years I had answered 7 questions  
* 1 question was __filtering Sendmail mail ques with regular expressions__.
* 1 question was how to __access raw CSS style sheet elements__. 
* The other 5 were __SCTE-35 related__.

#### My shameless self-promotion
* I mentioned __threefive once__. 
* I  mentioned __x9k3 once__ , 
* I mentioned __iframes once__. 

threefive, x9k3, and iframes are all open source and freely available.
As far as the validity of my answers, they offered no critique. 
they didn't say any of them were wrong, they just said my answers might be incorrect and that concerned them. 

#### Why did so many moderators have to team up to send me an email?

#### Are they trying to use A.I. or something?
















#####  ADDENDUM








I may have slept with one of the moderator's mom ... and sister.
